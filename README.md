# music-player-manager
add/remove songs ,play next /previous, shuffle or loop playlist
This C++ code creates a basic music playlist manager with a doubly linked list. A Song structure holds each song's title, artist, and next and previous pointers to allow navigation in both directions. The Playlist class has methods to control the list, including adding a song, removing the current song, playing the current song, and moving to the next or previous song. It also enables saving the playlist to a file and reloading it, so there is persistence between sessions. The playlist begins by trying to read from a file called playlist.txt. If no such file exists, it begins with an empty list. User input can add songs, and any modification (such as adding or removing a song) writes the file out to keep it up to date. The user interface is console-based and provides a menu to execute all these operations. The program in general shows the principles of object-oriented programming, dynamic memory allocation, and simple file handling in C++ nicely. It can be further augmented with functionality like search, sort, shuffle, or utilizing a more organized file format like JSON or CSV for better data handling...
